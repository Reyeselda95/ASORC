Install Firefox 30 (latest version) onto Oracle Solaris 11
As you know Oracle Solaris 11 (11.1, 11.2) comes with Firefox 17 ESR and Mozilla 17 ESR, which is very good news. I have had no problems with this version until now when I upgrade our Oracle Database 12c to 12.1.0.2 and found out that I could no longer access the Enterprise Manager Database Express via the browser since you require Firefox 24+.

Thankfully someone has compiled there our later version and placed them in mozilla contrib locations http://download.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases. 
 Download latest version firefox-30.0.en-US.opensolaris-i386-pkg.bz2 (sparc version available and a tar version is also available)
Uncompress and install
# bzip2 -d  firefox-30.0.en-US.opensolaris-i386-pkg.bz2
# pkgadd -d firefox-30.0.en-US.opensolaris-i386-pkg
 Firefox is now ready to run, but you need plugins. Copy your existing plugins from Solaris 11 install location. Note the new location
# cd /usr/lib/firefox
# find plugins -depth -print | cpio -pdm /opt/sfw/lib/firefox/browser
If you haven't already got Adobe Flash installed you can get it from an archive file. http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_11.2.202.228_archive.zip
# unzip fp_11.2.202.228_archive.zip
# bzip2 -dc fp_11.2.202.228_archive/11_2r202_223_32bit/flash_player_11_2r202_228_solaris_x86.tar.bz2| tar xf -
# cp flash_player_solaris_11_2_202_223_x86/libflashplayer.so /opt/sfw/lib/firefox/browser/plugins
That it away you go.
# /opt/sfw/bin/firefox
